# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis-Project
**Hotel Booking Prediction**

This project is focused on predicting hotel booking cancellations using machine learning models. The dataset contains various features related to customer bookings, including demographic information, booking details, and hotel-specific factors. The goal is to build predictive models that can accurately classify whether a booking will be canceled or not, helping hotels optimize their operations and revenue management.

**Project Structure**

>**Data Preprocessing:**

Data cleaning and feature engineering steps are implemented to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and create new features that add valuable information for prediction.


>**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
>
Visualizations and statistical analysis of the dataset to gain insights into key factors that influence booking cancellations.


>**Feature Selection:**
>
Identifying the most important features that contribute to the prediction of booking cancellations.


>**Model Building:**
>
Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated for performance, including:


Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks

**Model Evaluation:**

Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curve. Cross-validation techniques are used to avoid overfitting.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

Optimization of model performance using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for selecting the best hyperparameters.

**Deployment:**
The final model is deployed as a REST API or integrated into a hotel management system for real-time predictions.
